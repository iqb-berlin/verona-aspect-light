1.16.0
 - Fix text with background and font color
 - Fix line-height property for radio button group
 - Set default line height of 135 for likert and text
 - Fix dropList values in player
 - Allow indentation with individual sizes
 - Move radio button label 1px (!) to the top
 - Change radio button color to dark green
   For all elements using radio buttons.
 - Fix missing translation for "Andere Optionen durchstreichen"
 - Add section element list
   It is part of the section menu (appearing to the left of the hovered section)
   This allows to select elements without clicking them on the canvas, as
   elements may be obstructed or not visible for some reason.
   Also when an elements is selected it briefly gets z-index 100 so it is
   moved to the front and visible and manipulatable.
 - New element for cloze: toggle-button
   This is a replacement for actual radio button groups. Will be extended
   with colors in the next release.

1.15.0
 - New element frame ("Rahmen")
   (Tested and working for static layouts. Usage in dynamic layouts at one's
   own risk.)
 - TextEditor: New functionality to create hanging indent
   It now also possible to set the indent size. It will be used for hanging
   and normal indents.
 - Fix reading of droplist element IDs
   Should now correctly recognize already given (/read) IDs and refuse.
 - Fix creating elements in empty (i.e. newly created) dropLists
 - Improve property panel layout
   Delete and duplicate buttons are no longer part of the tab view. They are
   always visible below it.
 - Fix min-height showing up before being checked
 - Make text elements no longer start with a margin
 - Fix image scaling for radio-image element
   Images are scaled down when needed. Small images do not scale up.
 - Improve drop list item margins
   Horizontal orientation no longer has a wrong bottom-margin on the last
   element but elements now have a margin sideways (5px).
 - Reduce unused space in textarea

1.14.0
 - Fix reading of existing drop lists
 - Fix reading of highlight properties of text elements
 - New elements:
  - Slider
  - Spelling
 - Text elements have a general font size again
   Specific parts of the text can still have a different font size
   applied to them.

1.13.0
 - Remove underlinable option for text
 - Offer a choice of colors for marking text
 - Fix text element with background color and font color at the same time
 - Add proper label to textarea and reduce vertical space around text
 - Add 30px default bottom-margin to likert and radio
 - Rework dropList items to have an ID and allow images references
   To use images a text option has to be created like before. The image
   can be set afterwards. When an option has both a text and an image, the
   text is ignored and the image is shown.
 - Improve ID-Service to free up IDs when elements are deleted
 - Improve cloze element all around - most importantly allowing to manually
   size sub-elements

1.12.0
 - Add new element cloze ("LÃ¼ckentext")
   Similar to a text element but parses the text on change and replaces
   markers with actual ui elements.
   The text is then displayed in line with the elements.
   Allowed markers are presented by buttons in the text editor but can
   also be entered manually. Implemented by now are "\i" for inputs
   and "\z" for drop Zones.
   It is now possible to select sub-elements (in addition to the parent cloze element)
   to alter element properties as usual.
   This element is still in development and contains functional and visual issues.
   Known issues:
    - To generate the text and elements you have to open the TextEditor at least once.
    - Elements are regenerated everytime the text is changed. This means they get a
      new ID and lose changed property values.
    - Text styling (like bold) does not continue after an inserted sub-element.
      To work around that, the style has to be applied separately to the text before
      and after inserted elements.
    - Changing dimension properties of sub-elements does not work.
 - Add typographic quotes to TextEditor's special characters
 - Fix radio button alignment
   Should now always correctly line up with the text on different line
   heights.
 - Allow element deletion regardless of the selected section
   This has the additional benefit of allowing to delete multiple selected
   elements in different sections.
 - Setting list style in TextEditor now also toggles the list (when not set)
 - Setting list style in TextEditor applies the selected font size to the list counter
   It takes the selected font size, which is indepent of the font size of the items
   in the list. If you change the font size you may have to re-apply the font size
   to the list. This can be done by selecting the wanted style again.
 - Changed default values:
   - font size: 20px
   - likert and text: line-height: 135px
   - likert and audio: width: 250px
   - page: margin: 30px
 - Revert likert heading with images to not scale the images
 - Improve visuals of radio-button-image elements
   Images are scaled again but behave a little better.
 - Make min-height optional

1.11.0
 - New DropList feature: highlightReceivingDropList ("Potentielle Ablagen hervorheben")
   When set eligible dropLists display a highlight effect. Currently with
   a colored border. The color is adjustable.
   This needs to be set on the target list, NOT on the list items are being
   dragged from.
 - Refactor likert layout and add first column ratio property
   Images now scale depending on the available space.
   The new property controls the first (column) size parameter for the
   grid. The others are fixed at 1. Decimal values are allowed for
   fine-tuned control.
 - Improve TextEditor toolbar layout and functionality
   Reordered the controls to make it look nicer. The sub menu no longer exists.
   Improve layouting to prevent elements from moving unexpextedly on different
   window sizes.
   Changed color and list inputs to split-buttons. Those combine a button
   with a dropdown allowing to specify the action of the button.
   For lists this does not actually toggle the list. The button needs to be used
   after setting the style. For colors the color is set immediately after using
   the dropdown/color picker.
   Now saves the set color and it can be applied to subsequent selections as well.
 - Change dropList styling
   (Item margins and dropList border radius)
 - Improved cursors everywhere
   Notice how the cursor changes to the grabbing hand on click before
   actually dragging canvas elements!
   The resizing preview in dynamic mode is no longer obstructed by the
   element itself. It is now hidden while resize-dragging.
   Color inputs now have the pointer cursor.
 - Fix TestEditor (console) error when using the bullet-lists
 - Fix likert column-edit dialog to set values on save
 - Move some styling properties to the styling tab
   Applies to: borderRadius, itemBackgroundColor

1.10.0
 - Fix reading of existing likert element row values
 - Fix reading of existing dropList elements
   (This element was internally reworked and no longer has the 'options' property.
   To remain backwards compatible old 'option' lists are now correctly transformed to 'value' lists.)
 - Fix textarea edit dialog to use multiline dialog
 - Improve dialog sizing and styling

1.9.1
 - Make text underlinable
 - Fix marking of text

1.9.0
- Fix dropList element 'connectedTo' property renaming
- Implement 'readOnly' setting for dropList element
  This prevents reordering items.
- Add 5px margin between 'radio-group-image' images
- Improve dropList styling
  (background of draggable items, drop-preview, animations etc.)
- Add property 'itemBackgroundColor' to dropList
- Replace text element 'highlightable' with 'interaction' dropdown
  Multiple interaction themes are possible but mutually exclusive (for now).
  Player support will follow soon.
- Implement setting 'likert' preset value

1.8.1
- Add index indicator to option-list preset value
- Add alternative radio button group with images
  Automatically aligned horizontally with a vertical label on top.
  The label can contain text and/or an image. The label is clickable
  to select a value.
  Images are not scaled at all.
- Add small preview images to option list for radios with images
- Remove image scaling from likert
- Rename likert to 'Optionentabelle'
- Fix value of button actions to refer to unit instead of page
- Fix hidden autoStartDelay property
- Add magnifier properties to properties panel
- New element DropList ('Ablegeliste')
  This element has a list of strings as editable options. Those strings
  form draggable elements which may be reordered or moved between
  different DropList elements.
  To be able to move elements the DropLists need to be configured with
  the ID of the target DropList.
  There is an additional switch to allow only one item in a list.

1.7.2
- Add showRestRuns property to player-elements
- Fix (several problems with) likert element
  - Headings with Images should also work better now
- Fix radio-button-group label margin
  (Was accidentally removed in the last release)
- Fix editing properties of multiple selected elements
- Fix disappearing style properties when deleting the value

1.7.1
- Add radio-button-group property for strike-through of unselected options
- Allow setting 'first' and 'last' as button actions
- TextEditor: Add whitespace to special characters menu
  This allows multiple whitespaces after one another. Also keeps word groups
  from 'linebreaking'.
- [bug] TextEditor: Show empty paragraphs outside of the TextEditor
- Add extra field for manual background color selection
  Before it was not possible to switch back to transparent, since the color
  picker does not allow alpha channel settings. This also should make it easier
  to put the wanted color without having to navigate the picker.
  NOTE: The color picker does not recognize 'transparent' or any other color
  notation but hexadecimal. The preview is then always black.
- Make radio button and first line of the option text (in case there is a line
  break) appear at the same height
- Audio-/Video-Player: Use steps (of 1000) for timer fields
- Remove 'underlinable' property from text elements
  This feature will have to be reworked from scratch and will be re-introduced
  in a different form later.

1.7.0:
- [bug] Fix resize (drag and drop) in dynamic sections
- Replace element selection indicator from border to outline
  This makes element contents not move when selected.
- Allow deselection of elements
  Clicking anywhere (but the side panels) will deselect elements. This makes
  it easier to get an impression of how it will look like.
- Add 'line-height' property to all elements which have a font
- Add 'rows' property to text areas
- Change text property input to textarea
  This allows to properly enter longer default texts in text areas. (This is
  also active for text-field elements, where it makes little sense but makes
  it technically simpler to not differentiate).
- Fix lables on text fields
  Now correctly uses a proper label instead of a placeholder.
- Change text field appearance depending on label existence
  When the label text is empty the field will be rendered a lot smaller (and
  without any label obviously)
- Change font-size property to number field
- Improve radio-button-group styling
  Add 10px margin between label and options.
- Fix likert elements sizing
  This should make the selected background color cover the whole element instead
  of just the upper 100 pixels.
- Improve bold text style to be less bold and have letter spacing
- Add read-only property to all input elements and likert
- Allow changing the line-coloring color for likert elements
  (not to be mistaken for background color)
- Add 'underlinable' property to text elements
  This is to allow different purpose markers on text. Does NOT work in the
  aspect-player yet.

  When set, a button at the end of the field appears which allows deleting the
  field's content.
- Add "position" property to "always-visible" pages
- [bug] Fix option elements saving value index instead of actual option string
  This allows duplicate (or empty) options.
- Fix TextEditor indent setting to persist when re-opening text element
- Improve TextEditor margin logic
  Default margin of paragraphs is 0px. It can now read existing margin
  settings.
