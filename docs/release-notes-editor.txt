1.10.0
 - Fix reading of existing likert element row values
 - Fix reading of existing dropList elements
   (This element was internally reworked and no longer has the 'options' property.
   To remain backwards compatible old 'option' lists are now correctly transformed to 'value' lists.)
 - Fix textarea edit dialog to use multiline dialog
 - Improve dialog sizing and styling

1.9.1
 - Make text underlinable
 - Fix marking of text

1.9.0
- Fix dropList element 'connectedTo' property renaming
- Implement 'readOnly' setting for dropList element
  This prevents reordering items.
- Add 5px margin between 'radio-group-image' images
- Improve dropList styling
  (background of draggable items, drop-preview, animations etc.)
- Add property 'itemBackgroundColor' to dropList
- Replace text element 'highlightable' with 'interaction' dropdown
  Multiple interaction themes are possible but mutually exclusive (for now).
  Player support will follow soon.
- Implement setting 'likert' preset value

1.8.1
- Add index indicator to option-list preset value
- Add alternative radio button group with images
  Automatically aligned horizontally with a vertical label on top.
  The label can contain text and/or an image. The label is clickable
  to select a value.
  Images are not scaled at all.
- Add small preview images to option list for radios with images
- Remove image scaling from likert
- Rename likert to 'Optionentabelle'
- Fix value of button actions to refer to unit instead of page
- Fix hidden autoStartDelay property
- Add magnifier properties to properties panel
- New element DropList ('Ablegeliste')
  This element has a list of strings as editable options. Those strings
  form draggable elements which may be reordered or moved between
  different DropList elements.
  To be able to move elements the DropLists need to be configured with
  the ID of the target DropList.
  There is an additional switch to allow only one item in a list.

1.7.2
- Add showRestRuns property to player-elements
- Fix (several problems with) likert element
  - Headings with Images should also work better now
- Fix radio-button-group label margin
  (Was accidentally removed in the last release)
- Fix editing properties of multiple selected elements
- Fix disappearing style properties when deleting the value

1.7.1
- Add radio-button-group property for strike-through of unselected options
- Allow setting 'first' and 'last' as button actions
- TextEditor: Add whitespace to special characters menu
  This allows multiple whitespaces after one another. Also keeps word groups
  from 'linebreaking'.
- [bug] TextEditor: Show empty paragraphs outside of the TextEditor
- Add extra field for manual background color selection
  Before it was not possible to switch back to transparent, since the color
  picker does not allow alpha channel settings. This also should make it easier
  to put the wanted color without having to navigate the picker.
  NOTE: The color picker does not recognize 'transparent' or any other color
  notation but hexadecimal. The preview is then always black.
- Make radio button and first line of the option text (in case there is a line
  break) appear at the same height
- Audio-/Video-Player: Use steps (of 1000) for timer fields
- Remove 'underlinable' property from text elements
  This feature will have to be reworked from scratch and will be re-introduced
  in a different form later.

1.7.0:
- [bug] Fix resize (drag and drop) in dynamic sections
- Replace element selection indicator from border to outline
  This makes element contents not move when selected.
- Allow deselection of elements
  Clicking anywhere (but the side panels) will deselect elements. This makes
  it easier to get an impression of how it will look like.
- Add 'line-height' property to all elements which have a font
- Add 'rows' property to text areas
- Change text property input to textarea
  This allows to properly enter longer default texts in text areas. (This is
  also active for text-field elements, where it makes little sense but makes
  it technically simpler to not differentiate).
- Fix lables on text fields
  Now correctly uses a proper label instead of a placeholder.
- Change text field appearance depending on label existence
  When the label text is empty the field will be rendered a lot smaller (and
  without any label obviously)
- Change font-size property to number field
- Improve radio-button-group styling
  Add 10px margin between label and options.
- Fix likert elements sizing
  This should make the selected background color cover the whole element instead
  of just the upper 100 pixels.
- Improve bold text style to be less bold and have letter spacing
- Add read-only property to all input elements and likert
- Allow changing the line-coloring color for likert elements
  (not to be mistaken for background color)
- Add 'underlinable' property to text elements
  This is to allow different purpose markers on text. Does NOT work in the
  aspect-player yet.

- Improve deleting elements via Delete key
- Add Input Assistance property to input elements
  This can be activated by selecting one of the presets, which are mutually
  exclusive for now.
- Add "clearable" property to text field element
  When set, a button at the end of the field appears which allows deleting the
  field's content.
- Add "position" property to "always-visible" pages
- [bug] Fix option elements saving value index instead of actual option string
  This allows duplicate (or empty) options.
- Fix TextEditor indent setting to persist when re-opening text element
- Improve TextEditor margin logic
  Default margin of paragraphs is 0px. It can now read existing margin
  settings.
